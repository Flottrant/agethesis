# UKThesis [![Build Thesis](https://github.com/adryyan/ukthesis/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adryyan/ukthesis/actions/workflows/build.yml)

LaTeX class file and template for a thesis written at University of Kassel.
Forked from [maxnoe/tudothesis](https://github.com/maxnoe/tudothesis) and
adjusted to Uni Kassel.

The template is build for use with _lualatex_ and _biblatex_ with _biber_,
the class file can be used with the LaTeX engine of your choice, it is completely independent.

This is an unofficial document which [@maxnoe](https://github.com/maxnoe) created from his bachelor thesis, which itself
was strongly influenced by the latex files which [@kdungs](https://github.com/kdungs) used for his bachelor's thesis.

All used packages and commands are explained
in depth in the materials of the PeP et al. LaTeX Workshop:
